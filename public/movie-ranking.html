<h1>The Best Movies According to Cyprian</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Equalizer 3</h3>
<p>The way the movie is created, Denzel focuses on helping people without seeking anything in return from them. He doesn't even want to
be known in that way.</p>
<h3>Stomp The Yard</h3>
<p>Great and relaxing dance movie. Competitive yet emotional at the same time. Motivational.</p>
<h3>The Great Wall</h3>
<p>Shows the power and strength of being united.</p>
